# Actor-Screen-Time
Video Analysis Using Deep Learning Algorithm

Identify the character of TV series and calculates its screentime.

Aim of this project is to transfer the image classification problem into a video analysis problem. I was trying to find a way to build a model that automatically identified specific people in a given video at a particular time interval. And it turned out that we can do it.
So a small application of this project can be used as calculating a screen time of a person in the video. And this project is focusd on same application and I have built a small POC (proof of concept ) to check how it works.
